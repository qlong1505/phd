20090210 : got user code fully working including interrupts.

20090208 : tried adding delays to main loop after usbPoll().
           used "stepper_motor_demo +100" as timing reference.
              0 ms : demo took 4 secs.
              1 ms : demo took 4.5 secs.
              2 ms : 7 secs
              3 ms : very slow, died after  7 secs.
              4 ms : very slow, died after 10 secs.
              5 ms : very slow, died after 10 secs.
             10 ms : very slow, died after 10 secs.
           Conclude user code should delay less than 1ms, but blowing
           out to longer times on an intermittent basis is OK.
